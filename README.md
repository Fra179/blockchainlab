# 🔬 Blockchain Laboratory

> Blockchain Laboratory: running ₿itcoin experiments.

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Download the latest jar from [`github.com/danielfalbo/blockchainlab/releases`](https://github.com/danielfalbo/blockchainlab/releases)
2. Run `java -jar blockchainlab.jar` to launch the app in interactive mode

## 🧫 Example Experiments

### Simple Transactions

Bitcoins are transferred between agents and transactions are validated by miners competing in constructing blockchains.

### Double-spending

A malicious agent attempts to create a double-spending transaction by submitting payments attemps for a larger amount of coins than he owns. The system will make sure he never spends more than he owns.

### Invalid transaction

A malicious miner attempts to create an invalid block that includes an invalid transaction moving bitcoins to his wallet from someone else's withous his consensus.

### Bogus Transactions

A malicious agent attempts to flood the network with bogus transactions to disrupt the validation process.
